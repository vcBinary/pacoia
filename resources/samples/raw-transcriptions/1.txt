"TripAllin it's a platform that is going to change to way you plan trips it is going to be
a platform that is is going to be beginning of your dream trip eh firstly we want to show you
why TripAllin is necessary em tourism is one of the planet's largest industries it has been
growing for sixty eight years and it is going to be growing for the next ones eh in fat in one
point eight em sorry ah it is estimated to be one point eight billion tourists in twenty thirty
which is the twenty per cent of the world population em we want to improve the the experience
we want to improve the tourism by promoting local business by eh showing eh the the cheapest eh
trips and... showing users the the much more possibilities well eh when was the last time you 
planned a trip and you were lost or or you fair lost or not sure of what were you doing well we 
want ot change this experience to.. this... this is TripAllin eh I explained why eh we're we 
ideated this and now Nacho is going to explain how we are going to fo it 

so... as Alberto have said as Alberto have said eh we want to eh we want to improve the customer 
experience and we are focusing on three main points eh we need to be possible to plan everything 
you want to in your travel in just one search in one query we want people to discover new 
activities or... things they want eh things they want to explore or like and finally we want our 
app to adapt your to your budget so if you have a lot of money it will so you expensive plans 
and if you don't have money it will try to give you the best for the money you have 

so how are we how it works we are combining two main core technologies web scrapping and cluster 
computing eh web scrapping is a is a kind of a technology or algorithms which takes data from the 
internet so you don't need eh an api or a partnership which another company to access their data their 
data because you basically you are eh using their website and taking the data and cluster computing 
em it's a technology which allows us to divide the workload for servers eh getting faster responses 
and... eh improving the... user experience so when one user access TripAllin they input all the data 
about what they want eh if they want a trip or they want to live an experience these kinds of things 
so when they eh pre-search it goes to the main server and the main server decides which kind of 
operations they have to perform like eh what website you want to scrap or... which languages they 
are going to explore and divides the workload around all the servers which eh finally will they 
make a response they will make it available to the main server and will send it again to the user 
and... finally eh we want to be sure we can okay we can eh allow the user to make a unique payment 
they want to eh they will be able to eh pay all the trip at once and it will support endless custom
travel possibilities because using scrapping algorithms you are not limited to any kind of form 
or input data and 

in conclusion eh the objective of TripAllin is eh improve and raise international 
tourism eh make it and easier one and easier one experience because now a days is horrible and 
finally we want to encourage local business because now a days websites like um eh google flights 
or more or more em wow eh this kind of websites which provides you with possibilities before your 
plans eh use some... corn sources not small business which are invisible in the internet and we 
want to change that and that's all that's TripAllin"
