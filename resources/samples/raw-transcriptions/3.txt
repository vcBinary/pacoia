"Hello my name is Monica and this is my team Cesar and Pablo I am going to introduce you our idea
BibliotecApp make sure you have a place to study as you know study is very important and with this
APP you don't have any excuses to not study well look at this picture what does it inspire you in
my view that inspires me the first one is how many times have you arrived at library and you have not
found any free seat to study image the situation you are go at from from home with your backpack your
motivation to study and you arrive and... oh oh not seat and... now what can I do come back home and
watch the last episode of game of thrones no it's time to study and the second question is... how much
time do you spend eh searching for the library that suit your needs 

to answer this question I want to explain the current situation today to find a library people use 
internet like google normally the first step is to introduce the name of the library or libraries 
of Madrid and you select one of them and we can see the information of the library like address phone 
number etc and below usually em google show a graphic related to the flow of people during the day 
now I information mentioned above em firstly the information is not centralized why because the 
information of each library is in different websites secondly the schedules are not updated during 
exam periods and this can confuse people and finally the information about the flow of people is 
very very limited is not real now my colleague Pablo is going to explain the innovation 

thank you Monica so what can I... eh what can we... do for solve this problems first eh we are going 
to install a... counting system named 3D alpha plus eh manufactured bet V counts in eh every library 
eh then also we are eh to get updated schedules during period exams for example or another a normal 
periods eh also we will have eh centralized all of this information from all the libraries and finally 
you can filter this information eh okay eh now what eh what are the we what are we going to do with 
all of this information eh we are going to show you detailed information of libraries for example 
em the schedules or the location of each library and the most important feature is that you will see 
in real time eh all the availability of the seats in in your eh library so you will never get to a 
library and find that you don't have free seat eh and how it works okay first of all the sensors will 
collect all the data from the libraries eh then eh it will communicate with a central system that
stores and analyze the data and this data apart from the the people in the library is the location 
or the schedules finally the information eh will be displayed eh in the app and the final users eh 
of BibliotecApp eh will find the library that fits best their needs and now my colleague Cesar eh 
will conclude this presentation 

thank you Pablo the anticipating impact that we expect is that every kind of student of use this 
application could be university students highschool students or anyone who wants a place to study 
or a place to concentrate to read or whatever the path forward from now on consist of three phases 
the first phase is to install all the equipment and the sensors in the entrance of the libraries to 
so we can count all the people that are going in and out the second phase is the designing and 
development of the central system that will respond to queries done by the users when when they want 
to search som em libraries near or apply some complex filters and the third phase will be designing 
the... and programming the web interface or the application even Android or IOS and 

as we have said the expected potential end users are any kind of em students that don't want to waste
too much time searching for a library and the conclusions of our of this project is that with this application we could 
fit the needs of eh of any students that wants a place to study by making quick searches and finding a library near their location
and providing accurate information like real time seat availability and.. em information about the schedules and be updated so
any questions"
