"I would like to thank you for... letting your time sleep with me and I am trying to present
I Ismael my friend Carlos and my friend Daniel our app virtual urban sports league I have two
questions the first is what do you need to play a game usually you need one thing one place to
play players and then you have a perfect match but what if you don't have the motivation like
the place or like the players eh we are trying to provide you to a solution to maybe brake your
chains brake the chains of of their sloth that beans you in house and doesn't let you go out go
out and play with your friends with some unknown people well first eh I will pick about why people
doesn't go out to you I don't know eh to play basketball to play football um maybe they have a 
little voice that ask that tells them no no no no today maybe tomorrow but eh with our app with 
three short words we can maybe not convince you but at least em get you a based to do it the first 
is to who the where and the why the who is who will play with you maybe you don't hand that friends 
that are athletic or maybe you don't hand friends or maybe I don't know the every people is a 
worm em maybe um you can use tinder and ask a match oh why if we play basketball on a regular 
schedule and the chances of that working are very slim 

but with our app that helps you find a partner and to our symbol a team maybe you can have a starting 
point then the where maybe you don't play because you don't have a facility oh you don't have a... 
football... a a street to... kick a ball with our app you can use the city council's APIs to eh 
let to make reservations and make sure you don't get um you don't you aren't leave without a place
to play and then is the why why will you play maybe just to get fit maybe just to have a good time 
but why if you got that um the adrenalin of victory the humbling of defeat then our app helps you to 
make and manage tournament and urban leagues eh and of course you need to find your arbiters your 
everything but our app helps you to make a not so rigid schedule that maybe um at least force you 
to... go out and then well my friend Carlos will keep up with the technical details 

okay so em our solution is fairly simple we just do what you used to did on paper but we do it 
digitally so eh okay so eh really fast hahaha em we give players the ability to make teams and 
the teams to the ability to make tournaments which then they can create matches on but that is 
not it we also give them the ability to book facilities which then used to be a mess but now it's 
really easy with our app we centralize the... ability for you to to make eh reservations on facilities 
and how do we do it okay if this is simple the technical difficulties are literary none because 
we are going to use eh existing web technologies that have years and years of background and usage
so... it's really... a known ground we'll say eh and the scheme is really simple also we have eh 
and eh em an authentication platform which you can go in with your google or facebook account or 
whatever then em you go into the frontend and make em your teams if you are a player you can make 
tournaments assign prices or whatever and of course you can make matches that can be also independent 
from the tournament if you just want to play a match em all of that is powered by a backend or a 
server that creates the tournaments with a simple draft algorithm and em two APIs one for our 
database where we store our users our application data and another one that goes directly to the 
sports facilities council servers and... em allows us to book your facilities and it's this as 
simple as it gets the application technology is really simple 

so now well our potential user are the city councils that can allows us to manage their reservations 
of the city the sports brands they can build loyalty and make themselves known by creating sponsored 
competitions with prices and merchandising and the most obvious are the professional athletes that 
can manage your own competitions and find other people that practice your favorite sports eh 

as we have seen there are no applications that are capable of working with several sports allow 
you to manage allow you to manage your own competitions reserve sports facilities and find partners 

our application can do it as we have seen eh we do not use any new technologies it can be implemented
quickly and it's very easy the idea you find the partner with whom to practice you can create or join 
a team and participate in create your own competition and for that I encourage you to invest in 
our application thanks for your attention"
