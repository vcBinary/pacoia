"... Okay so we are group four the only thing I have here worth worth mention is that Alfonso 
is not with us because is a bit sick at his house so I'll do his part as well okay so our solution 
is a student a student guard for the control and monitoring in class for exams mostly so this 
comes from a big problem which is lost exams eh with a bit of hope most of you haven't suffered 
this having lost and exam or something lost paperwork but what if it actually happened to you as 
we say in the student council lost exams are like taxes you don't care about them until they 
actually happen directly to you okay so first of all we have to find what is a lost exam okay 
what happens if you loose your exam or it disappears first of all according to UPM nothing 
because it isn't defined there is no process no contemplation nothing on the issue and as well 
what happens there there is no proof is your word against the professor's nobody know what happened 
there 

okay so there is a very easy solution for this which is a system's control right very easy we we 
all have our cards very simple to use so how does this work UPM has has their control which depends 
on professors checking your student card very easy checking your number with the DNI with your face 
very easy right but imagine having to do that with two hundred and fifty students this makes the 
professor check every single student wastes a lot of time on the professors's part also this is 
completely optional professors do not have to do this what does that mean that that it isn't used 
okay well obviously we are not the first ones to actually notice this problem some solutions have 
been done in this school but they do not answer to the three most important problems which is first 
of all lost exams current solutions do not prove anything they just prove that you were on the exam 
but you didn't handed in who can prove that after that we have that that control is really inefficient
professor waste a lot of time going each student one by one walking to all the single people imagine 
estructura with five hundred students doing that with every single student that's a lot of wasted 
time and also a third problem identity fraud imagine now that you were to retake programaci√≥n uno 
would you do the exam again for one of your friends if they do not check your card anyone could do it 
right this leads to a lot of problems actually 

so what is our solution very easy proof of deliverance  how does this work you check your student 
card after you hand in your exam so if you hand in your paperwork then check in using your you 
proof that you left your exam there so your responsibility ends there that's the university's 
problem after that and what is our solution this red box very simple very small of course it's 
not empty it has all the technology inside of it really simple to use and what does this have 
first of all is very small okay really really small it's fast and easy to use all you need to 
do is swipe it like this easy really simple where is this box situated if this worst in the 
professor's table or for example lets take the most obvious solution of the professor were sited 
here we just leave the thing right there just like that and when the student finishes his exam 
he just hands in his exam and there is the paper and scans and he is good to go okay how does 
this work as soon as you scan your card a picture pops up so that way you don't need to check every 
student one by one as you scan your card your profile picture pops up and the professor checks 
immediately if the same picture is the if the picture on the card is you so that way you can avoid 
identity threads and lastly is uses available resources I mean supposedly all we all have this card
which has NFC but on the other hand this thing is really cheap not much maybe three euros and you 
can print your own cards which are NFC cards for three cents okay so after that I am going to leave 
you with my friend Daniel which is going to show you how the prototype works 

eh hello my name is Daniel Bermejo and I am going to talk you about the first prototype eh that 
little red box it has an arduino nano and a RFID sensor to read the cards and of course the RFID 
cards of the students eh in the red box we have an arduino program and in the computer a processing 
program to read the data that generated the the arduino and the case is 3D printed so is very 
cheap and it is very easy to modify if we change the hardware eh as we can see we can use a lot 
of arduino boards eh the code will be the sam in all that boards and you we use here the arduino 
nano so is only three euros is very cheap eh also the RFID sensor three euros very very cheap too 
and of course the RFID cards if you buy a lot of them are around three cents per card eh here is 
the eh software architecture in the arduino part we have arduino code eh in the computer a 
processing code and they are communicated with a USB cable and here is the eh arduino prototype 
case eh I printed it with my ender three with PLA plastic and it takes around one hour and a 
halve and it's of course very cheap and I will show you a demo of the of the prototype okay so we 
have here the this red box connected to the computer okay so we run here the program we swipe the 
card and you can see my picture and of course it is imagine that is from yours Jorge when you 
swipe it you can see his picture so is very fast and very easy to use 

okay so now what does this actually bring us the advantages of doing this okay so first of all 
it's really fast as you was it is immediate teacher do not have to waste their time that they 
could be using answering your questions they can be seated doing their tasks and students do 
not need to have their cards out and maybe break their concentration when they are doing 
something really important also as well there is an immediate solution for lost exams since you 
scan your card after your brought your exam in it's not your problem any more okay it it is up 
to the professor department or whoever it is that may have lost or whatever happened to the exam 
okay after that when you do that you're leaving a record of who is actually going there and 
scanning you are leaving a database which is very useful for evaluation metrics to check up who 
went to the exam who actually handed in the exam etcetera and last but not least is the identity 
fraud is really simple as soon as you scan it your picture pops up check him check you okay all 
fine you are set to go really simple really easy this can be used in very practically all 
scenario exam projects practicas everything but the downside is that how many of you do actually 
use that card I mean I use it for the cinema the student discount nothing else so if we are 
going to use this product we will need to motivate people to actually bring their cards back 
to the university and our current and last and last presentation our path forward so right now 
as you have seen we we have a functioning prototype but the thing is to actually use it on 
large scale tests our arduino nano is really small and to fit more code into it we will need 
to develop a new pro prototype which is a little bit bigger like ten per cent or twenty per 
cent bigger okay after that we evaluate the metrics is it working is it fast enough is it 
actually useful and after that we just develop the new case the new scenario and we are set 
to go okay that's all thank you very much"
