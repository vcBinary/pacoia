"About the technology that we have envisioned which is called hyper is a technology
that what it does is em split the workload of any of any application between eh users
of set application em what we are trying to achieve is something like this think of the
ants as the users of of any application of any computer in need of eh extra computational
power imagine you have a a low low standard computer from ten years ago and you wish to use 
a computer application demanding greater computer power em one solution would be to buy a 
new computer an another one would be to rent eh through a network the computational power 
which is what we are offering em giving here is the power to collaborate and to and to 
achieve greater things em so the need that we are trying to solve is the rising... the rising 
trend to... for for users to to use em higher end applications such as em physics simulations 
or computer games eh so if you need any any extra computational to power to increase the the 
time of of of the the use you are giving the application em 

hyper is gonna help you to do that and it it's the competition to some other technologies
that are not free that are such as amazon web services that basically you can rent computer 
power which is one of the services they provide so so what's new with hyper that doesn't that 
you can't get with with any of these technologies is that it is free it is faster and it is 
easy to use and Andr√©s is going to you how this is achieved 

thank you so eh we want to connect your world eh but hyper is not a product itself is a 
technology that we want to use so let's customize our connections and see how we can eh do 
ourself eh networks to do the computations that we want for example there can be a university 
network or one made out by eh providers of the actual solutions for eh cluster computations so 
we have eh developing eh develop two systems the first one is a token system that will do is 
a... the each user is going to have tokens that can exchange for computations so a user can eh 
spend its own tokens to get faster computations just eh using it in the network that he eh forms 
but also he can receive tokens by renting their their eh resources their devices resources so 
eh be the reason eh because someone smiles today let's say eh we want that eh hyper is a 
distributed network so eh every every member is going to serve their own resources with the rest 
of the members the other system that we are going to.. to use is a caching system that is going 
to leverage the the behavior of of this networks just by eh getting the the results stored and 
that can be consulted again if there is an opportunity so eh for doing that we are going to split 
the the queries that network has in smaller ones and eh that queries when they are solved are 
going to be eh yep storing distributed databases that is allocated on the network eh so eh with 
this with this eh system there is no need to compute the same query so hyper is going to be eh 
our main product that let's eh the worlds be connected to share eh our resources so let's use 
hyper"
